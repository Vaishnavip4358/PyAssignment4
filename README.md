# Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This repository contains my submission for Assignment 4. The project demonstrates how to handle file operations (Read, Write, Append) and manage errors using Python's exception handling.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
**File:** `task1_read.py`
- Opens and reads a file named `sample.txt`.
- Prints the content line by line.
- Uses `try-except` blocks to handle the `FileNotFoundError` gracefully.

### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
**File:** `task2_write.py`
- Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`.
- Appends additional data to the same file.
- Reads and displays the final content of the file.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Vaishnavip4358/PyAssignment4.git](https://github.com/Vaishnavip4358/PyAssignment4.git)
